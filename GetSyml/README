Get symmetry line. syml.* from ctrl.*

In this directory, we have getsyml.py, which is based on the
seekpath at https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/
and spglib

===========================
Requirement and Install:

0.
Install Anaconda2. It contains all scientific tools.
We need python 2.7 or higher (probably),
not 3.x (if 3.x, need to modify getsyml.py)

1.
spglib
for crystal structure symmetry
See its home page to install for anaconda case.

2.
seekpath
>git clone https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/
>python setup.py install --user



===========================
Usage: (we use python2. We probably need some fixing for python3)
Make softlink getsyml.py as getsyml. Then
>getsyml nio
or
>getsyml ctrls.nio 
This show 3D Brillouin zone together with symmetry lines for band plot.
The symmetry lines are written into the syml.* file.
You can edit syml.* for bandplot by the job_band command.
The number of divisions for syml is give by simple algorism, so edit
it if necessary.


===========================
Needed citations when we use.
  In addition to usual ecalj acknowledgement,
  following citations are required when you make a publication.

   1.Y. Hinuma, G. Pizzi, Y. Kumagai, F. Oba, I. Tanaka, 
     Band structure diagram paths based on crystallography,
     Comp. Mat. Sci. 128, 140 (2017) 
   2.You should also cite spglib that is an essential library used in the implementation.

============
See Lincence.txt for spglib and seekpath.

TODO:
   a.Modify lmchk to write required information to supply reasonable.
     For example, ndiv (mesh size along lines).
   b.Numerical accuracy of calculations. 
     np.set_printoptions(precision=16) is not meaningful since we read
     output of lmchk
